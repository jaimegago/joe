# Joe — Decisions

Append-only project decision log. Newest entries at the top. Each entry
records what was decided, the basis (verifiable source, not assertion), and
what it supersedes. This file is normative: where a decision here conflicts
with prose elsewhere, this file states the project's position and the
conflicting prose is stale.

Format per entry: ID, date, decision, basis, supersedes, status.

## D-0003 — Phase 2 streaming protocol and tool-execution boundary

- Date: 2026-05-28
- Decision: Phase 2 (single agentic runtime, Plan-of-Record §3 / D-0001) is
  implemented with two binding protocol/architecture choices:
  1. **Streaming protocol: Server-Sent Events (SSE).** joe-core → CLI streaming
     of the single agentic loop uses `text/event-stream` with named events
     (`step`, `local_tool_call`, `final`) on `POST /api/v1/tasks/stream`. The
     control direction (CLI → joe-core, delivering delegated tool results) is an
     ordinary `POST /api/v1/tasks/stream/{taskID}/tool-results`, so SSE's
     unidirectionality is not a constraint. Chosen over chunked newline-JSON
     because SSE is self-describing and the existing React Web UI can later
     consume the same endpoint via the browser `EventSource` API — one protocol
     for CLI and Web UI.
  2. **Tool-execution boundary: local tools execute in the CLI (callback path).**
     Local tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `run_command`, `local_git_*`,
     `ask_user`) keep executing in the `joe` CLI process. The CLI advertises them
     as `client_tools`; joe-core registers delegating stubs so the LLM can call
     them, emits a `local_tool_call` event, and suspends the loop until the CLI
     posts the result. Rationale: preserve the security property that the CLI's
     filesystem/shell access is bounded by the operator's own shell, not by
     joe-core's process (which may run as a daemon/container/remote host).
     Shared (Go-native diagnostic) and core tools run inside joe-core's loop.
- Consequential choices recorded here:
  - **`/model` is now a global operation on the single runtime.** Switching the
    model hot-swaps joe-core's `services.LLM` (a `SwappableAdapter`) for all
    consumers; there is no per-CLI-session model. This is the direct consequence
    of "one LLM contact point"; a per-session override is out of scope because
    it conflicts with "exactly one adapter instantiated process-wide".
  - **The CLI requires no provider API keys.** It makes no LLM calls; keys live
    only in joe-core.
  - **Token accounting simplifies (not implemented here).** With one loop,
    joe-core's loop is the single authoritative tally (`taskResponse.total_tokens`);
    there is no second CLI-side count to reconcile. Token *visibility* is
    deferred polish, explicitly not built in Phase 2.
  - **The agentic loop was relocated** from `internal/useragent` to
    `internal/agentloop` (joe-core-owned). `internal/useragent` no longer exists;
    the CLI's build closure links no adapter-factory, provider, or loop package
    (asserted by a guard test in `cmd/joe`).
- Basis: PLAN-OF-RECORD-RECONCILED.md §3 (Phase 2 + completion gate);
  PHASE-0-SESSION-MODEL.md Invariants 1 and 6; docs/PHASE-2-IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md.
- Supersedes: nothing — first streaming/tool-boundary decision. The pre-Phase-2
  CLI-local agentic loop + CLI LLM adapter are removed.
- Status: active. Phase 2 complete.

## D-0002 — Phase 0 session model is the normative session-model design

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Decision: `docs/PHASE-0-SESSION-MODEL.md` is the normative output of the
  refactor's Phase 0. Phase 1 implementation is built from it. Its
  accompanying state diagram is a comprehension aid; where the document and
  the diagram disagree, the document governs.
- Scope closed by it: the original six refactor open questions; incident mode
  (emerged during design, load-bearing); the authority-layer integration
  verified against current code (§G of that document).
- Basis: PHASE-0-SESSION-MODEL.md (closed); Security & LLM-Execution
  Architecture Findings (code verification).
- Supersedes: nothing — first normative session-model artifact.
- Status: active. Phase 1 references this document, not chat history.

## D-0001 — Refactor Phase 3 deleted; refactor is two phases

- Date: 2026-02-16
- Decision: The agentic-runtime refactor collapses from three phases to two.
  Phase 3 ("collapse the /tasks loopback HTTP-to-self") is **deleted**, not
  merged or rescoped. The end-state acceptance criteria formerly nominal
  under Phase 3 are reattached to Phase 2 as Phase 2's completion gate. No
  work is lost; no work is created.
- Why delete (not merge/rescope): Phase 3's entire scope was collapsing a
  core→core HTTP loopback. Code verification found that loopback does not
  exist (joe-core's Core Agent uses its own `*tools.Registry` directly and
  does not call joe-core's own HTTP API). Merge implies residual Phase 3
  content to fold in — there is none. Rescope would invent work to preserve a
  phase number — the consistency-for-its-own-sake failure mode the project
  rejects (cf. PHASE-0-SESSION-MODEL.md R5). The single-agentic-runtime end
  state is reached as a consequence of Phase 2 (removing the CLI's own loop +
  LLM adapter), with no further step.
- Basis: Security & LLM-Execution Architecture Findings §4;
  PHASE-0-SESSION-MODEL.md §G1/§G2. The phantom phase is recorded here so a
  future reader does not rediscover the absent loopback and re-add a Phase 3
  to "complete" the sequence.
- Supersedes: the prior plan-of-record's "sessions → migrate REPL → collapse
  loopback" three-phase sequencing. The reconciled plan-of-record
  (`docs/PLAN-OF-RECORD-RECONCILED.md`, §5 Reconciliation Record) is the full
  audit trail; this entry is the index pointer to it.
- Status: active. The original plan-of-record file carries a supersession
  header pointing here and to the reconciled plan.
